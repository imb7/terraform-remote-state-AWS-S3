# terraform-remote-state-AWS-S3

This is a sample Terraform project demonstrating the use of remote state management.

## Overview

This project sets up a basic a simple AWS S3 bucket. It utilizes Terraform's remote state feature to store the state of the infrastructure in a centralized and secure location. This is essential for:

* **Collaboration:** Allowing multiple team members to work on the same infrastructure.
* **State Persistence:** Ensuring the state is not lost if your local machine fails.
* **State Locking:** Preventing concurrent modifications to the infrastructure.
